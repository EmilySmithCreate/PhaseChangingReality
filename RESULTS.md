# Every registered test, one line each (as of 4 November 2026)

Verdict words are as scored on the record. "Owner" is her prediction and whether it held; "(inf.)" means the
assistant inferred it from her positions and marked it so; "—" means none recorded. "Where" names the archive's
`PREREGISTRATION.md` section and `ASSUMPTIONS.md` O entry, which hold the full reading (rule 17: one fact, one
home). Tests registered in this repository from its creation on go in this repository's own
`PREREGISTRATION.md` and are added here.

| Test | What it asked | Verdict as scored | Owner's prediction | What it means now | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1–T5 | Tooling: rectangular tori; the full energy with λ; connectivity readers; ergodicity at N ≤ 18; parallel tempering | DONE | — | exact averages at N = 16, 18 validate every sampler; tempering trusted to g ≈ 3 at N = 160 | TASKS T1–T5, Q8, Q9, Q11 |
| Gate A | Reproduce the published λ = 0 behaviour (jump, hysteresis, shattering into knots)? | PASSED (owner's decision) | — | the model reading and sampler reproduce the published λ = 0 case | TASKS Gate A |
| Gate B | Reproduce [T25] Fig. 3 at λ = 1? | OPEN; cannot pass with either variant (matches [KTB19] Fig. 8a to rms 0.005 instead) | — | the two published figures disagree; a question for the authors | TASKS Gate B, O27 |
| Gate B‴ | Is Fig. 3 the printed (half-coefficient) Hamiltonian, our λ = ½? | NOT REPRODUCED at every λ | REPRODUCED or CLOSER: failed | the coefficient is not the explanation | PREREG Gate B‴, O149 |
| Gate C | Reproduce the published six-link curve [T22] Fig. 3? | FAILED | — | six-link results carry the open-gate caveat (U24) | TASKS, O43 |

| T54 | The smallest opened patch of a slab that grows, priced exactly (held out L = 16) | held-out numbers HOLD; words RISES AGAIN (unscored) / FIXED WALL | CRITICAL PATCH: not scored / fails by the letter | the numbers are completed-patch energies, not barriers (O118) | PREREG T54, O118 |
| T55 | What are the pieces of 2 and 8 that no cooling removes? | KNOT at both sizes | SEAM: failed | the scrap is three knots of fixed energy | PREREG T55, O107 |

| T82 | The twin gate | WITHDRAWN before any run | — | — | PREREG T82 |
| T83 | Is curl on a warm 2D sheet felt at a distance? | LONG by the letter; a defect's own footprint in substance | SHORT: fails by the letter (gate was the assistant's error) | reach needs the links of three dimensions | PREREG T83, O165 |
| T84 | Do two relics pull together via relaxed link lengths, and is light delayed? (exact landscape, held out L = 24) | SHAPE ONLY | CLOSES and DELAYED: held; our band failed | — | PREREG T84, O167 |
| T85 | Does one α fix both light's delay and the pull (γ = 1)? | DRIFTS ACROSS b and KNOTS; held-out numbers held | ONE α: fails by the letter | the drift across b was the test's own definition | PREREG T85, O168 |

| T88 | Does a rod fed at one end open as one front from that end? | NOTHING below the wall; ONE FRONT at 30 a store; SEVERAL at 60; held-out holds | ONE FRONT (inf.): holds at 30, fails at 60 | the front is paid by the fed stores, not by its release | PREREG T88, O171 |

| T97 | The curl-pair daughter: does a surplus grow with λ? | GROWS THEN FLAT; surplus share = 1/R | A SURPLUS GROWS WITH λ: holds up to the full curl | the billion-to-one picks a size, not a λ, under this form | PREREG T97, O180 |

| T101 Am. 1 | The same at λ = 1 with one planted knot, g = 1, 1.5, 2 | FASTER NEAR KNOT in every cell (read 6 Nov); STILL in none (open space never moved in 6 of 9 replicas, where the knot healed) | SLOWER (inf.): failed | the sign is the same at λ = 1 as at 1.25, so the setting was not the cause; the move count is a clock of activity, not of proper time; the time half still has no carrier | PREREG T101 Am. 1, O186 (archive) |
| T102 | Is the toy's Klein relative a store or a knot? | KNOT (32(λ − 1) at every L; wall ≈ 21) | STORE (inf.): failed | in this toy a Klein store is a knot of fixed size | PREREG T102, O185 |
| T103 | The two kinds as her moves on a flat torus: does the number of Klein stores rise with λ? | MIXED (2 stores in 240 cells; effectively none at every B) | RISES: failed | the ledger is spent making pairs before any store can be paid, so under this form stores cannot form; the same-sign curls left with no room, the raw material for stores, rise with λ (0.01 to 0.18 per square); net twist exactly zero; books balance to the digit | this repository's PREREG T103 |
| T104 | T103 with the store's price from gravity (a join costs the ledger nothing): do stores rise with λ now? | MIXED (2 stores in 240 cells; effectively none) | RISES: failed | the cause is the sweep's order, ours: cancelling link after link before joining empties the sheet and leaves no square without room; with room judged all at once (sandbox look) stores form and rise with λ; the clock form is hers (T105) | this repository's PREREG T104 |
| T105 | T104 under her clock (room judged once on the made state, all pairs at the same instant): do stores rise with λ? | RISES (none at λ ≤ 1.10; 0.10, 0.18 to 0.23, 0.42 to 0.48 per square at 1.25, 1.50, 2.00; held-out size 24 within ±30 %) | RISES: held | under her rules and clock, stores form once the release packs the sheet and their number rises with λ; both signs equal; net twist zero; stores sit together more as λ rises | this repository's PREREG T105 |
| T107 | The seed on the boundary of the loose remnant, and the kind on each side: a foot on each side; the outside foot grows, the inside stops; the feet joined (read); mirror images under her kind rule; the size (read) | MIXED (1 HOLDS 0.75 to 1.00, 0.85 held out; 2 outside larger at +500 HOLDS at 32, 48, 64 and FAILS at 128 (0.35), the inside bounded HOLDS; 3 joined 0.75 to 1.00; 4 mirror images HOLDS, 0.68 to 0.81, the sign matching the outward kind in 54 of 57; 5 the size 0.021 to 0.009, falling) | her five (hers by adoption): 1, 2b, 4 held at every length; 2a failed at the held-out length | the seed straddles the loose remnant's edge and her kind rule sets the sign at every length; "larger at a fixed time" was a criterion that scales with the band (said before the run); the replacement is growth, T109 on her words; the size's trend is T108 | this repository's PREREG T107 |
| T108, T109 | From T107's run form on fresh seeds: does her surplus ratio fall with length (T108), and does the outside foot gain more than the inside between 200 and 500 sweeps after the escape (T109)? | T108 FALLS (0.026, 0.023, 0.013, 0.010, 0.0053 at 32 to 256; about 1.0/L, slope near −0.8; held-out 256 inside the written 0.0026 to 0.0058); T109 FAILS (0.85, 0.70, 0.85, 0.40, 0.15: the inside foot grows inside the wide band, the outside foot's growth within 500 sweeps is small at large lengths) | inferred: T108 FALLS as a/L held; T109 HOLDS failed; hers to confirm or reword 9 Nov | the surplus's size falls with length as the boundary row's share, reaching a billionth only near 10⁹ links; "the inside foot stops" holds only while the band is narrow; the kind rule's sign held again at every length (16 of 16 at 256) | this repository's PREREG T108 and T109 |
| T110 | T109's replacement on her words of 7 Nov: the outside foot's gain positive over a window that scales with the length (× L/32), lengths 32 to 128, 256 held out | registered 7 Nov 2026, before the run; running at the fitting lengths | hers: above one half at every length | — | this repository's PREREG T110 |

Not registered or never written: T14 (became T17), T20, T28 (the gravity test, designed only), T29, T31, T35,
T70, T96 (not needed once "the options" were decided).

## Readings corrected after scoring (the verdict stands; the picture does not)

- **T7 and S2′.** S2′ was written after T7 had met four of its five parts; T7 is never presented as having cleared it.
- **"Opens into a sheet" (T7, T8, T23, T24, T60).** 9,208 of 9,215 exactly flat end states are the tube with its seam shifted by two, six around (O116).
- **T9 "melted".** A sealed tube cannot melt at these λ; every "melted" run kept 94 % or more of its squares (O123).
- **T10, T11 "ring".** A four-point column lying along the tube (O16).
- **T30.** First read FIRST ONLY (the analyser had pooled the gas); as registered the tori are NEVER OPENS.
- **T34, T42, T57 "melt".** One to a few flickering scars, nothing curled (O82).
- **T37.** The long warm tubes melted; the "mosaic" and the "factor of ten" readings are withdrawn (O88, O89).
- **T38.** TWO POPULATIONS supersedes UNCLEAR; O109 then read most long waits as the detector's; T58 and T59 found one memoryless population.
- **T45, T46.** The 5.36 target of their fits is withdrawn (O89).
- **T54.** The numbers are completed-patch energies, not barriers (O118).
- **T56.** The one rod replica that read OPENS is a rod glued differently; stage 2 is not run, so nothing may say the slab stays shut "at every size".
- **T61.** The "flat and eight around" end state is two pieces (a torus and a Klein bottle).
- **T65.** The tie was withdrawn after launch; the untied control is the cell that speaks to the hypothesis.
- **T66.** The observable measures a fluctuation, not healing speed; disclosed, not repaired.
- **T71.** The control was fed 1/N_slab of the arms' feed per point; a properly fed control is a new cell.
- **T83.** The scoring gate admitted near-perfect sheets; LONG is a defect's own footprint.
- **T84.** The chain form was withdrawn; the exact landscape is what was scored.
- **T85.** The drift across b for an isotropic knot is the test's own definition; T100 is the consistent form and still drifts by ±30 %.
