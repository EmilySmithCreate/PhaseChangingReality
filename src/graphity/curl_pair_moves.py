"""The two kinds as moves on the curl state (docs/design/curl_pair_moves_2026-11-04.md; her answers of 4 November 2026,
sandbox/NOTEBOOK.md the same day). Her rules put in and read back; nothing derived.

HER RULES (hers, 3 and 4 November): a pair is made full, +1 curl with +1/2 twist and -1 curl with -1/2 twist, on the two
squares sharing a link, costing two units of the release. A pair cancels into two photons when there is room; if not,
the pair stays apart, and each half finds a matching (same-sign) twist and joins it into a two-sided Klein store, so a
failed pair makes two stores of opposite sign. A store cannot move and cannot cancel. Twist is not a second number: a
full curl carries a half twist of its sign, and a store is a flag meaning two halves joined into one full twist. Seeded
sweeps: make pairs while the ledger can pay, cancel where there is room, join where there is none, freeze when a sweep
changes nothing. No cooling, no bath.

OURS (stand-ins, marked in the design document): "room" on a sheet is an empty square beside either square (T97's form).
Which square of a link gets the matter is a seeded coin. Any +1 and -1 on squares sharing a link may cancel, not only
the two born together. A cancelled pair's energy leaves as light and never returns (her step 3: once there is room, the
light leaves). A store is paid from the ledger: the barrier B (no value from her; scanned) plus the curling cost
4(lambda - 1) for its square; the emptied partner's curl joins the store. The ledger starts at the release 4(lambda - 1)
per point in units where one full curl is one unit.

HER RULE OF 4 NOVEMBER, AFTER T103 (price_from="gravity"): the store's price comes from gravity, "which is one directional and
doesn't get lost as it's spent but increase as it's spent to make more dense particles". Stand-in (ours): a join costs the
ledger nothing; a one-way counter `gravity` grows by B + 4(lambda - 1) at every join and is never spent. A count, not an
energy, in this build. price_from="ledger" is T103's form, kept so that T103 reproduces.

HER CLOCK OF 4 NOVEMBER, AFTER T104 (clock="simultaneous", "Yes to 1"): room is judged once on the made state, for every
pair at the same instant; the pairs with room cancel into light and the same-sign neighbours without room join into
stores, each square used once, cancellations first. clock="sequential" is T103's and T104's sweep (cancel link after link,
then join), kept so that they reproduce; its order was ours and is what left no square without room (the T104 reading).

HER KIND RULE OF 6 NOVEMBER (kind_rule="boundary"; T107): "the first pair made across the boundary sets the outside
foot's kind, and everything after follows it". With `dist` (each square's distance from the band's centre) and `edge`
(the band's half width) given: the first pair whose two squares straddle the edge draws the outward kind once (a
coin, so that twins of opposite sign appear across replicas); every pair made after it puts that kind on its square
farther from the centre (a tie keeps the coin). kind_rule="coin" is T103 to T105's rule, kept so that they reproduce.
Stand-in (ours): the straddling test and the farther-square placing; her words name neither a coin nor a tie.

HER REVERSAL OF 6 NOVEMBER, NIGHT (twist_rule="second_number"; docs/design/twist_second_number_2026-11-06.md): twist is its
own number again. Each square carries c (curl) and t (twist in halves). A pair is made as before, +1 curl with +1/2 twist and
-1 with -1/2. Where there is room the two TWISTS cancel into light and the curls stay behind as dark gluons (|c| = 1, t = 0,
the neutral pion's shape); a gluon does not move, join or cancel again, and counts as room for its neighbours (choice 3).
A store is one loop over two diagonals (her choice 3 of the twist-energies brief): the join marks both squares and keeps
both curls, so a store holds two units. The light a cancellation releases is the twist's share s of each unit
(twist_share, default 1/2, a stand-in until the twist-energies reader gives it); the rest stays on the gluons.
twist_rule="one_number" is the rule of 4 November, kept so that T103 to T107 reproduce bit for bit; it never touches t.

EXACT: ledger + light + (curl held on squares) + (held in stores) = the release, to the last digit, after every move,
under both forms (under "gravity" the store holds only its partner's curl in the one-number rule, both curls in the
second-number rule), both clocks and both twist rules; on the sheet net twist is zero by the one-to-one rule.
